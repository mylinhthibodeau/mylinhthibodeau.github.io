## How much time does learning clinical bioinformatics take?

I thought it might be helpful to provide a general idea of how much time would be required to acquire specific clinical bioinformatics skills. The following time estimates are quite rough and the time requirement will vary greatly between different individuals.

Learning is a continuous process, but if you were to add up together all the bits and pieces of time dedicated to a specific process, I think the following estimates might roughly capture the time requirements:

* Git/Github: 1-2 days
* Installing tools from the terminal: 2-3 days
* Install R language + RStudio + install some useful libraries: 0.5-2 days  
* Install Python language + pick an editor + install some useful: 1-2 days
